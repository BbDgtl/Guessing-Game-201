GUESSING GAME by: Bobby Spencer

This assignment builds a webpage with a guessing game attached. This guessing
game will ask a series of 5 questions in a yes/no format about me. At this time,
the game will run through if/else statements attached to each question and then
inform of whether the user is correct. If incorrect, the user will be informed
of the correct answer.

The game also writes the correct answer to console.log.

The Driver was: Bobby Spencer
The Navigator was: Bobby Spencer :)

Initially, a function was added to each question, but realized in doing so, the
entire program would run regardless if the user said they didn't want to play.
Created one function to encompass, then added DOM manipulation to the alerts.
