GUESSING GAME by: Bobby Spencer

This assignment builds a webpage with a guessing game attached. This guessing
game will ask a series of 5 questions in a yes/no format about me. At this time,
the game will run through if/else statements attached to each question and then
inform of whether the user is correct. If incorrect, the user will be informed
of the correct answer.

The game also writes the correct answer to console.log.
